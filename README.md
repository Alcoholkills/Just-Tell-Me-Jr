# Old Part

This is a project to wait until I know how to xcode

## Python Version

We need a :

- Graphical interface
- Save module
- Logical backend

### TODO

UNIT TEST BABY & WRITE DOC

I need to write the graphical interface, that's gonna have 3 windows:

- The first one, main one, shows the button to display an activity
- The second one shows a form to add a new entry, add a SubActivity, or remove an entry
- The third one shows a menu to modify the probabilities of the entries
```
